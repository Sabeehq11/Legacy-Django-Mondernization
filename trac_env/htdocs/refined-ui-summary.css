   - Timeline spacing: 2-3rem between events

âœ… 5. ENHANCED GLASSMORPHISM:
   - Increased blur effects (15px instead of 10px)
   - Better contrast ratios for accessibility
   - Stronger borders (2px instead of 1px)
   - Improved shadow layering for depth

âœ… 6. RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
   - Mobile-first breakpoints at 768px
   - Collapsible navigation for smaller screens
   - Adjusted padding/margins for mobile
   - Improved touch targets (44px minimum)

âœ… 7. TYPOGRAPHY & READABILITY:

   - Hover: Green accents (#43e97b) for interaction feedback
   - Backgrounds: Darker overlays (rgba(0,0,0,0.3)) for contrast
   - Text: High-contrast white with proper opacity levels

ðŸ§­ NAVIGATION ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Darker banner background for better contrast

   - Layered shadows for depth perception
   - Proper backdrop filters with fallbacks
   - Consistent spacing between all elements

ðŸ”„ INTERACTION IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Smooth cubic-bezier transitions (0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
   - Scale transformations on hover (1.02)
   - Lift effects (translateY -2px to -3px)
   - Glow effects using box-shadow

ðŸ“± MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS:
   - Collapsible header layout
   - Stacked navigation buttons
   - Reduced padding for smaller screens
