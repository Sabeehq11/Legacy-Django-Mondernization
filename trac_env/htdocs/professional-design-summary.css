   - Simplified animations (150ms transitions)
   - High contrast ratios for accessibility
   - Clean focus indicators for keyboard navigation

ðŸŽ¨ PROFESSIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES APPLIED:

âœ“ Visual Hierarchy: Clear distinction between headers, content, and actions
âœ“ Whitespace: Generous spacing for better readability
âœ“ Consistency: Unified color palette and component styling
âœ“ Accessibility: High contrast and proper focus indicators
âœ“ Minimalism: Clean, uncluttered interface without distracting elements
âœ“ Professionalism: Suitable for software development teams and startups

ðŸš€ RESULT: 
The Trac interface now looks like a modern software platform that 
professional development teams would be proud to use. The design is 
clean, minimal, and focuses on usability rather than visual effects.

All functionality remains intact - this is purely a visual transformation.
