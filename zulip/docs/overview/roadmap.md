# Roadmap

We welcome participation from our user community in influencing the Zulip
roadmap. If a bug or missing feature is causing significant pain for you, we'd
love to hear from you, either in
[chat.zulip.org](https://zulip.com/development-community/) or on the relevant
GitHub issue.

Please an include an explanation of your use case: such details can be extremely
helpful in designing appropriately general solutions, and also helps us identify
cases where an existing solution can solve your problem. See our guide on
[suggesting features and improvements](../contributing/suggesting-features.md)
for more details.

## Server and web app roadmap

The Zulip server project uses GitHub projects and labels to structure
communication about priorities:

- We use a [GitHub project
  board](https://github.com/orgs/zulip/projects/9/views/13) to publicly track
  goals for major releases. The items with the "Done" status will be included in
  the next major release. Otherwise, the project board should be seen a list of
  priorities being _considered_ for the release, not a guarantee that features
  will be included. As the release date approaches, features that will not make
  it into the release are dropped from the project board on an ongoing basis.

- The [high priority][label-high] label tags issues that we consider important.
  It is reviewed in the planning stage of the release cycle to identify
  priorities for the next release.

- The [help wanted][label-help-wanted] label tags issues that are open for
  contributions.

The Zulip community feels strongly that all the little issues are, in
aggregate, just as important as the big things. Many resolved issues
are never explicitly tagged as release goals.

[label-high]: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22priority%3A+high%22
[label-help-wanted]: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22

## Mobile app roadmap

We use a [GitHub project
board](https://github.com/orgs/zulip/projects/5/views/4) to publicly track
milestones for Zulip's [next-generation mobile
app](https://blog.zulip.com/2024/12/12/new-flutter-mobile-app-beta/).
