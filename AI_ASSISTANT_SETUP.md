# AI Problem Solver - Setup Guide

## 🚀 Enhanced AI Ticket Assistant

Your AI Ticket Assistant has been transformed into an intelligent problem-solver that provides comprehensive analysis with the 5-section structure you requested:

1. **🚀 Quick Solutions to Try** - Immediate fixes with success rates
2. **🔍 Likely Root Causes** - Technical analysis with probabilities  
3. **📊 Diagnostic Information Needed** - Interactive checklists and commands
4. **📝 Complete Ticket Structure** - Developer-focused investigation paths
5. **🔗 Related Issues & Prevention** - Search queries and documentation

## 🔧 OpenAI API Integration

### Option 1: Add Your API Key (Recommended)
1. Open your browser's developer console (F12)
2. Run this command to set your OpenAI API key:
```javascript
window.OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';
```

### Option 2: Environment Integration
Add this to your application's environment variables or configuration:
```javascript
// In your app's initialization code
window.OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

### Option 3: Backend Proxy (Most Secure)
Create an API endpoint in your backend that proxies requests to OpenAI:
```javascript
// Modify the callRealOpenAI function to use your backend
const response = await fetch('/api/ai-analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ briefDescription, context })
});
```

## 🚨 Fallback System

When OpenAI isn't available, the system provides:
- Intelligent template matching based on keywords
- Problem-specific analysis patterns
- Complete 5-section structure maintained
- Interactive elements still functional

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Analysis Patterns
Add new patterns in the `generateSmartAnalysis` function:

```javascript
} else if (lowerDesc.includes('your-keyword')) {
    analysis = generateYourCustomAnalysis(briefDescription, context);
```

### Custom Templates
Create specialized templates by following the existing pattern:

```javascript
function generateYourCustomAnalysis(briefDescription, context) {
    return {
        solutions: "HTML content for solutions",
        causes: "HTML content for causes", 
        diagnostics: "HTML content for diagnostics",
        ticket: "HTML content for ticket",
        related: "HTML content for related"
    };
}
```

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

1. Go to any Trac page and click "New Ticket"
2. Scroll to the description field
3. You'll see the enhanced "AI Problem Solver" 
4. Enter a problem description and click "🔍 Analyze & Solve"
5. Navigate through the tabs to explore the comprehensive analysis
6. Use action buttons to apply results, copy content, or run diagnostics

The AI assistant now transforms from a simple formatter to an intelligent debugging companion that helps users solve problems immediately when possible and creates highly actionable tickets when needed!
